# LedAlarmApi webinterface
The webinterface allows to control the ledalarmapi from a website.

The webinterface itself does not provide any authentication as of now and can be
 used on an other  device that on the device running the ledalarmapi service.
To make it secure you must add basic authentication to it and serve it over https only.
